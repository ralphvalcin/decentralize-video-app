## Critical Issues Identified

### üî¥ **CRITICAL: WebSocket Signaling Connectivity**

**Issue:** WebSocket connections to the signaling server are failing consistently.
- **Success Rate:** 0% in load testing
- **Impact:** Complete inability to establish peer connections
- **Root Cause:** Potential signaling server configuration or network policy issues

**Evidence:**
```
WebSocket connection success rate: 0.0%
websocket_connection_success threshold crossed
```

**Recommended Actions:**
1. **Immediate:** Investigate signaling server WebSocket endpoint configuration
2. **Verify:** CORS and WebSocket upgrade headers on Render deployment
3. **Test:** Direct WebSocket connection from browser developer tools
4. **Monitor:** WebSocket connection logs on backend

### üî¥ **HIGH: HTTP Request Failure Rate**

**Issue:** 21.5% of HTTP requests are failing during load testing.
- **Failure Rate:** 21.5% (Target: <5%)
- **Impact:** Reduced reliability under moderate load
- **Potential Causes:** Rate limiting, timeout issues, or resource constraints

**Recommended Actions:**
1. **Analyze:** Server logs to identify specific failure patterns
2. **Optimize:** Request timeout configurations
3. **Implement:** Better error handling and retry logic
4. **Consider:** CDN or load balancing for better request distribution

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **MEDIUM: Room Creation/Joining Flow**

**Issue:** UI elements for room creation exist but the complete workflow is not easily accessible.
- **Impact:** User experience friction in core functionality
- **Evidence:** Test automation had difficulty locating consistent UI selectors

**Recommended Actions:**
1. **Standardize:** UI element selectors and data-testid attributes
2. **Improve:** User flow clarity and button labeling
3. **Test:** Manual user journey validation
