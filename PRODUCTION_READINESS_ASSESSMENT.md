| Connection Prediction | 0.03ms | <10ms | ✅ PASS |
| Layout Analysis | 58.26ms | <500ms | ✅ PASS |
| Memory Usage | 0.60MB | <50MB | ✅ PASS |
| Cross-Component Coordination | 225.72ms | <500ms | ✅ PASS |

### Load Testing Results
| Scenario | Users | Status | Performance |
|----------|-------|--------|-------------|
| High Concurrency | 50-100 | ✅ EXCELLENT | 3.12-3.35ms |
| Extended Session | 4+ hours | ⚠️ NEEDS_REVIEW | 67.2/100 stability |
| Real-World Usage | Various | ✅ EXCELLENT | 81-87/100 UX score |

## 🔧 **IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**

### Priority 1: Code Quality Resolution
```bash
# Required fixes before production:
1. Update ESLint configuration for Jest/Test files
2. Fix vite.config.js and build configuration globals
3. Resolve WebRTC module import issues
4. Clean up unused variables and imports
5. Fix React Hook dependency warnings
```

### Priority 2: Build Process Validation
```bash
# Post-fix validation required:
1. npm run lint (must pass with 0 errors)
2. npm run build (must complete successfully)
3. npm run test (all tests must pass)
```

## 🎯 **PRODUCTION GO-LIVE CHECKLIST**

### Phase 2.5: Code Quality Sprint (IMMEDIATE)
- [ ] Resolve all 531 ESLint errors
- [ ] Fix build process configuration
- [ ] Validate test framework compatibility
- [ ] Execute clean build pipeline

### Post-Fix Validation
- [ ] Re-run lint (0 errors required)
- [ ] Execute production build successfully
- [ ] Validate all AI performance benchmarks maintained
- [ ] Confirm load testing results remain consistent

## 📊 **RISK ASSESSMENT**

### **LOW RISK** ✅
- AI system performance and stability
- WebRTC peer-to-peer functionality
- User interface and experience
- Load handling and scalability
- Memory management and optimization

### **MEDIUM RISK** ⚠️
- Extended session stability (67.2/100 needs monitoring)
- Dashboard UI performance (testing incomplete)

### **HIGH RISK** 🚨
- Code quality issues preventing clean build
- Production deployment blocked by linting errors
- Test framework compatibility issues

## 🚀 **FINAL RECOMMENDATION**

### **CONDITIONAL GO - Immediate Code Quality Sprint Required**

**Timeline:** 1-2 days for code quality resolution

1. **Immediate Actions (Next 24-48 hours):**
   - Deploy dedicated team to resolve 531 ESLint errors
   - Fix build configuration and test framework issues
   - Validate clean production build pipeline

2. **Go-Live Criteria:**
   - ✅ 0 ESLint errors
   - ✅ Successful production build
   - ✅ All tests passing
   - ✅ AI performance benchmarks maintained

3. **Post-Launch Monitoring:**
