# Multi-Region Scaling Architecture for Decentralized Video Chat

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive multi-region scaling architecture designed to support 500+ concurrent users globally while maintaining <100ms signaling latency and 99.99% availability. The architecture leverages existing AWS EKS infrastructure (9.2/10 maturity) and extends it to three strategic regions with intelligent load balancing, cross-region state synchronization, and cost-optimized scaling.

**Key Results:**
- **Global Coverage**: 3 regions (US, EU, APAC) for <100ms global latency
- **Scaling Capacity**: 2-50 replicas per region, 500+ concurrent users
- **Cost Efficiency**: <$4 per active user, 70% spot instances in secondary regions
- **High Availability**: 99.99% uptime with automatic failover

### Regional Distribution Strategy

| Region | Role | Capacity | Users | Latency Target | Cost/Month |
|--------|------|----------|-------|----------------|------------|
| us-west-2 | Primary | 3-50 pods | 200+ | <50ms (US) | $800 |
| eu-west-1 | Secondary | 2-30 pods | 150+ | <50ms (EU) | $600 |
| ap-southeast-1 | Tertiary | 2-30 pods | 150+ | <50ms (APAC) | $600 |
| **Total** | - | **7-110 pods** | **500+** | **<100ms global** | **<$2000** |

## Global Load Balancing Strategy

### 1. DNS-Based Geographic Routing
```yaml
Route 53 Configuration:
- Latency-based routing for API endpoints
- Health checks with automatic failover
- Weighted routing for gradual traffic shifts
- CNAME records for regional CloudFront origins
```

### 2. AWS Global Accelerator for WebRTC
```yaml
Global Accelerator Setup:
- Dedicated IPs for WebSocket connections
- TCP optimization for signaling traffic
- Health-based endpoint failover
- Source IP preservation for session affinity
```

### 3. CloudFront Multi-Origin Distribution
```yaml
Origin Configuration:
Primary: us-west-2 ALB (weight: 60%)
Secondary: eu-west-1 ALB (weight: 20%)
Tertiary: ap-southeast-1 ALB (weight: 20%)

Behaviors:
- /socket.io/* → Global Accelerator
- /api/* → Latency-based routing
- Static assets → Nearest CloudFront edge
```

## Cross-Region State Management

### Redis Clustering Architecture

```
Redis Global Replication:
┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   us-west-2     │    │   eu-west-1     │    │ ap-southeast-1  │
│ ┌─────────────┐ │    │ ┌─────────────┐ │    │ ┌─────────────┐ │
│ │Redis Cluster│ │    │ │Redis Cluster│ │    │ │Redis Cluster│ │
│ │3M + 3R nodes│ │◄───┤ │2M + 2R nodes│ │◄───┤ │2M + 2R nodes│ │
│ └─────────────┘ │    │ └─────────────┘ │    │ └─────────────┘ │
└─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
         │                       │                       │
         └───────────────────────┼───────────────────────┘
                                 │
                        Global Replication
                        via Redis Streams
```

### Session Synchronization Strategy

1. **Room Assignment**: Users assigned to nearest region's signaling server
2. **State Replication**: Real-time sync via Redis streams between regions
3. **Failover Logic**: Automatic session migration on regional failures
4. **Conflict Resolution**: Last-write-wins with timestamp ordering

### Data Consistency Model
```yaml
Consistency Levels:
- Room State: Eventually consistent (5s max delay)
- User Presence: Strong consistency within region
- Chat Messages: Eventually consistent with ordering
- WebRTC Signaling: Strong consistency (no replication)
```

## Advanced Auto-Scaling Configuration

### Enhanced HPA Metrics

| Metric | Target | Scale Up | Scale Down | Purpose |
|--------|--------|----------|------------|---------|
| CPU Utilization | 60% | +100% in 15s | -25% in 2m | Basic resource scaling |
| Memory Utilization | 70% | +100% in 15s | -25% in 2m | Memory pressure handling |
| Socket.IO Connections | 80/pod | +5 pods in 30s | -2 pods in 5m | WebRTC capacity |
| Signaling Latency P95 | 100ms | +100% in 15s | -25% in 2m | Performance quality |
| Failed Connections | 5% | Immediate +3 pods | -25% in 5m | Error rate mitigation |
| Network Bandwidth | 50MB/s | +100% in 30s | -25% in 2m | Throughput scaling |

### Predictive Scaling Policies
```yaml
Scaling Triggers:
Weekend Peak: Scale up 2x at Fri 6PM, down Sun 11PM
Weekday Pattern: Scale up 50% at 9AM, down 8PM
Holiday Events: Manual scaling for anticipated load
Emergency: Circuit breaker at 90% capacity
```

### Node Auto-Scaling Configuration
```yaml
Cluster Autoscaler:
- Scale up delay: 30 seconds

- Max nodes per AZ: 7 (primary), 5 (secondary)
- Instance types: m5.large, m5a.large, c5.large
- Spot instance priority: 70% secondary, 50% primary
```

## Cost Optimization Strategy

### Spot Instance Management
```yaml
Spot Configuration:
Primary Region (us-west-2):
  - 50% spot instances
  - Instance diversification: m5, m5a, m5d, c5, c5a
  - Interruption handling: 2-minute drain time

Secondary Regions (eu-west-1, ap-southeast-1):
  - 70% spot instances
  - Aggressive cost optimization
  - Non-critical workload prioritization
```

### Reserved Instance Strategy
```yaml
Reservation Plan:
Baseline Capacity: 
  - 2 m5.large reserved per region (24/7)
  - 1-year term for 31% savings
  
Peak Capacity:
  - Spot instances for burst scaling
  - On-demand for guaranteed availability
```

### Cost Monitoring & Alerts
```yaml
FinOps Dashboard:
- Real-time cost per region
- Cost per active user metrics
- Budget alerts at 80% threshold
- Unused resource identification
- Weekly optimization reports
```

**Monthly Cost Breakdown:**
- Compute (EKS): $1200 (60% of budget)
- Networking (ALB, Global Accelerator): $300 (15%)
- Storage (Redis, EBS): $200 (10%)
- Monitoring & Logging: $150 (7.5%)
- Data Transfer: $150 (7.5%)
- **Total: $2000/month for 500+ users**

## Disaster Recovery & Failover

### Regional Failover Strategy
```yaml
Failure Scenarios:
1. Pod Failure: K8s auto-restart (30s recovery)
2. Node Failure: Cluster autoscaler replacement (2m)
3. AZ Failure: Multi-AZ deployment (immediate)
4. Regional Failure: DNS failover (30s switch)

Recovery Objectives:
- RTO (Recovery Time): 30 seconds
- RPO (Recovery Point): 5 seconds (Redis sync)
- Availability SLA: 99.99% (52.6 minutes downtime/year)
```

### Health Check Configuration
```yaml
Health Checks:
- Application: /health endpoint (5s interval)
- WebRTC: Connection establishment test
- Redis: Cluster health monitoring
- Cross-region: Latency and connectivity tests

Failover Triggers:
- 3 consecutive health check failures
- Latency > 200ms for 2 minutes
- Error rate > 10% for 1 minute
```

## Security & Compliance

### Network Security
```yaml
Security Measures:
- VPC isolation per region
- Private subnets for EKS nodes
- Security groups: least privilege
- NACLs for additional protection
- WAF with DDoS protection
- TLS 1.3 for all connections
```

### Data Protection
```yaml
Encryption:
- At Rest: EBS volumes, Redis, S3 buckets
- In Transit: TLS for API, WSS for WebSockets
- Key Management: AWS KMS with rotation
- Secrets: AWS Secrets Manager integration
```

### Compliance Considerations
```yaml
Regional Compliance:
- EU (GDPR): Data residency in eu-west-1
- US (CCPA): Data processing transparency
- APAC: Local data protection laws
- Cross-border: Encrypted data transfer only
```

## Monitoring & Observability

### Multi-Region Monitoring Stack
```yaml
Prometheus Federation:
- Regional Prometheus instances
- Global Prometheus for aggregation
- Cross-region metric collection
- Alert routing by region

Grafana Dashboards:
- Global overview with regional drill-down
- WebRTC-specific metrics
- Cost analysis views
- SLA compliance tracking
```

| Connection Success Rate | >95% | <90% | Call quality |
| Regional Availability | >99.9% | <99% | Service reliability |
| Auto-scaling Response | <2min | >5min | Load handling |
| Cost per User | <$4 | >$6 | Profitability |
| Cross-region Sync | <5s | >10s | State consistency |
