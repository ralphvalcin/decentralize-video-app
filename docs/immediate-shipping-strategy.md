useEffect(() => {
  if (peers.length >= MAX_PARTICIPANTS) {
    toast.error(`Room is full (max ${MAX_PARTICIPANTS} participants)`);
    // Optionally redirect or show waiting room
  }
}, [peers.length]);
```

#### B. Basic Room Persistence (2 hours)
```javascript
// Store recent rooms in localStorage
const addToRecentRooms = (roomId, roomName) => {
  const recent = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('recentRooms') || '[]');
  const updated = [
    { id: roomId, name: roomName, timestamp: Date.now() },
    ...recent.filter(r => r.id !== roomId)
  ].slice(0, 5);
  localStorage.setItem('recentRooms', JSON.stringify(updated));
};
```

    event,
    data,
    timestamp: Date.now(),
    userAgent: navigator.userAgent.substring(0, 100)
