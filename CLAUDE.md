# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

### Core Commands
- `npm run dev` - Start development server (runs on http://localhost:5173)
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint with React-specific rules
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build

### Server Commands
- `node signaling-server.js` - Start WebRTC signaling server (port 5001)
- `npm run start:signaling` - Start signaling server via npm script

### Production Deployment
- `./scripts/deploy-production.sh` - Automated production deployment script
- `vercel --prod` - Deploy frontend to Vercel

- Responsive design with customizable video positions

**Chat.jsx** (`src/components/Chat.jsx`)
- Real-time messaging with message history
- Unread message indicators and notification system
- Integrates with Socket.io for message persistence

### Signaling Server (`signaling-server.js`)
- WebRTC signaling server using Socket.io
- Manages room-based user connections and peer discovery
- Handles chat message persistence (last 100 messages per room)
- Supports user presence, hand-raising, and graceful disconnection

### Key Integration Points

**WebRTC Flow Details**:
1. User joins room â†’ Socket.io signaling server
2. Peer discovery via 'all-users' and 'user-joined' events
3. WebRTC signaling (offer/answer) through Socket.io
4. Direct peer-to-peer media streaming via simple-peer

**Connection Establishment**:
1. Socket.io Signaling:
   - Connects to signaling server at `localhost:5001`
   - Sends user metadata (name, room ID)
   - Receives list of existing room participants

2. Peer Discovery Mechanism:
   - 'all-users' event retrieves existing participants
   - 'user-joined' event triggers new peer connection
   - Implements ICE candidate exchange for NAT traversal

3. Peer Connection Lifecycle:
   - Create RTCPeerConnection instance
   - Add local media streams
   - Negotiate connection via offer/answer
   - Handle connection state changes
   - Implement fallback STUN/TURN strategies

**Connection State Management**:
- Tracks peer connection states:
  - CONNECTING
  - CONNECTED
  - DISCONNECTED
  - FAILED

**State Management:**
- React hooks for local component state
- Socket.io events for real-time synchronization
- No global state management library used

**Error Handling:**
- ErrorBoundary component wraps the entire app
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Robust reconnection logic in Room component
- Connection status indicators throughout UI
- Graceful degradation on connection failures
- Automatic reconnection attempts
- Detailed error logging
